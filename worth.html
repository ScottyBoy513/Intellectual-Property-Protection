  <p><h1>Why Do We Need To Protect Intellectual Property Rights?</h1></p>
  <p>We need to protect intellectual property rights because they give people incentives to create new and innovative ideas. Intellectual property rights protect the rights to creations of the mind which will include inventions, literary, and artistic works. If we do not protect the rights of intellectual property, it will allow people to steal ideas from other people and sell it as their own. Why would anyone want to create something if it means that people are just going to steal it from them?</p>
