  <p><h1>What Will Happen If My Solution Is Successful?</h1></p>
  <p>If my solution was successful, then there would be a decrease in crime rates that involve copyright issues and protection of intellectual property rights. If we could make sure that intellectual property rights are enforced, it would cause less people to try and steal works from other people because there would be a greater punishment. This would deter people from attempting to steal works from other people.</p>
